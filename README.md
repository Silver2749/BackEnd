# BackEnd Project

A Python-based backend application with authentication and CRUD operations.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Authorization Feature**: 
This project currently does not implement role-based authorization (user vs admin). This is an area for future improvement, as I am still learning and gaining experience with implementing proper authorization systems. Contributions and suggestions for adding this feature are welcome!
